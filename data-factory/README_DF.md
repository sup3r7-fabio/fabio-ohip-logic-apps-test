Data Factory notes:\n\n- Use the Data Factory UI or ARM templates to import `pipeline.json` and `linked-services.json`\n- The sample pipeline uses a Web activity to fetch mock OHIP data and an Azure Function activity to forward payloads to Service Bus\n- For a lightweight approach, implement a small Azure Function that accepts the payload and publishes to Service Bus using the SDK or connection string\
